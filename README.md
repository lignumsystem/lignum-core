## Compilation

Traditionally each lignum-core subdirectory and the main project have had Qt project (pro) files to compile.
The main project must tell in its Qt project file the location of the lignum-core. We have traditionally
had the main project at the same level as lignum-core directories.

CMake build tool has gained popularity recent years. One of the reasons is that it supports many IDE tools
including Xcode. lignum-core and its projects (directories) have *CMakeLists.txt* files to build lignum-core libraries
and binaries. Traditionally the CMake build process has been as follows:

	      mkdir build #Immediately under lignum-core directory
	      cd build
	      cmake ..
	      make
	      make install
	      
This generates Makefile system and adds Debug information in the compiler command line. 
The `cmake ..` command assumes that the *CMakeLists.txt* is in the immediate directory above. 
Note also that all build products are under *build* directory. To move them to proper locations
defined in CMakeLists.txt files `make install` is needed.

CrownDensity project has CMakeLists.txt that uses lignum-core projects and well known libraries (Qt, HDF5)
to build the project. To build Xcode project files:

   	      mkdir xcode #Immediately under CrownDensity directory
	      cd xcode
	      cmake .. -G Xcode

Open the *xcodeproj* file in Xcode. If in Xcode Product &#8594; Run is disabled check Product  &#8594; Scheme
that the binary is selected, not for example ALL_BUILD. The binary is in xcode/Debug. Depending on the implementation
the binary might have for example hard coded function file (*.fun*) names. 
Such files must be copied accordingly related to xcode/Debug directory.

As a third example to build CrownDensity Release (no debug information) version Makefile system

		mkdir release #Immediately under CrownDensity directory
		cd release
		cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
		make
		make install 

Use different directory names for different build types because they cannot coexists. 

Detailed documentation to follow. An outline of model structure can be found in the publications listed below.

Doxygen will be used to document software.
