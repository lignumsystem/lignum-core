/// \file stdafx.h
/// \brief Empty header file for Microsoft Visual C++ compiler 
///
/// \deprecated 
///This is deliberately empty header file.
///Microsoft  Visual C++ compiler requires stdafx.h to be            
///included in every source file (suffix cc, cpp etc.)
///On Unix this file can be included in the beginning of a
///source file. It is not possible to use conditional compiling.
///
///MS VC++ checks if *stdafx.h* is included.
